Welcome on this react project ! \
The goal of this project is to found the biggest area of the same color on a generated square.

## How does it works ?

To make it work you must first clone the repository:

 ```
Next go to your directory and run npm start command:
```

Now You can go on http://localhost:3000/ \
Type the number of rows, columns and colors needed. \
Then it will generate square and found the biggest area. \
That's all :thumbsup:
